<!-- If your plugin wants to add menu items to it's submenu off the new Extensions menu,
	 define them here. Each should have a unique menu id, a Name, and an Action. The last
	 is a method name in your python file that will be called when the user selects that
	 menu item. Note - nothing will be returned to the client, so if you need to communicate
	 back to the user you can post information into the Event Log.
